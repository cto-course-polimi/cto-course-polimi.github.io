# Evaluation

Evaluation is performed through a combination of oral exam and project work. The oral exam consists of a discussion of the topics covered in the course.

The project work can be taken in groups of one to three students, and in the following two modes:

 - An independent project activity, consisting in the implementation of an optimization or analysis pass in the LLVM compiler framework (suggested only for students with previous experience in C/C++);
 - A supervised project activity (21-28 hours), consisting in the implementation of a compiler for a toy language targeting the ARM assembly language. The sessions will be organized as follows:
   - Recursive descent language parsing
   - Transforming the Abstract Syntax Tree into a Control Flow Graph
   - Design and implementation of the symbol table
   - Function call translation
   - Liveness analysis
   - Register allocation (linear scan)
   - ARM code generation (table-based)

Independent project activities also replace the oral exam, while the supervised
project activity does not.
